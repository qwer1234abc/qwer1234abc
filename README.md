Hi there I am Kelvin, I am an enthusiastic student currently pursuing my education at Ngee Ann Polytechnic in the School of ICT. Fueled by an unwavering passion for Information Technology (IT), I have deliberately chosen this course to delve deeply into the intricacies of the field.

From a young age, the captivating world of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has consistently held my fascination. Observing AI's remarkable ability to emulate human-like actions, behaviors, and cognitive processes has inspired me greatly. The potential for AI to not only complete tasks efficiently but also to simulate human-level and even surpass it, has ignited my belief in its transformative power to shape the future of our world.

My journey in the School of ICT has not only solidified my commitment to the IT domain but has also afforded me the opportunity to explore the vast possibilities that arise at the intersection of technology and human ingenuity. I am excited to continue harnessing my passion for IT and AI to contribute meaningfully to the ongoing technological revolution.
